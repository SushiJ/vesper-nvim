# vesper-nvim

Port of [vesper](https://github.com/raunofreiberg/vesper) for Neovim.

### TODO
- Improve the colors 
- Add support for more plugins in the near future.


> Disclaimer: I have zero experience building plugins and themes for neovim. Not thoroughly tested. might have broken edge cases.

Repositories I took inspirations from:

1. [tokyodark](https://github.com/tiagovla/tokyodark.nvim)	[code]
2. [vesper](https://github.com/raunofreiberg/vesper) [Original colorScheme]
